How many people does it take to build a Web Designer's Portfolio?

One Designer, and approximately fifty people bugging him to put something - anything - out there.

It's a scary thing - putting yourself out there. Publicly exposing all your work to the cold harsh criticism of the internet. You don't know who might see your work, which makes every detail, every imperfection a hundred times worse than it actually is. Oh God, they're going to see that that thing isn't perfectly aligned or the kerning on those letters is off! What kind of amateur would put this shit together?

But there comes a point when you overcome the desire for everything to be perfect - the moment of quiet desperation when you go - anything will do. A flaming turd covered in eggplant emojis is better than nothing. You stop caring about what font perfectly describes the eternal struggle of a designer's whimsy and a coder's precision and you go, 'right, Open Sans it is'. Part of you dies at that point, and it's a good thing. It's the part of you that's holding you back. preventing you from making decisions because you're too scared that they're not the best possible decision that you could have made in retrospect. For the first time you internalize the fact that any decision - even the wrong one - is better than none at all.

When you're in love, all the songs on _that_ Spotify playlist start to make sense. When you hit fuck it, you really properly start to understand that saying - "Done is better than perfect." It's a painful feeling and not very pleasant if I'm being perfectly honest. But it's all part of the process of moving forward. And trust me, once you've hit rock-bottom, there's only one way to go.

So here's to hitting 'fuck it' - may I never have to feel this feeling again. I hope this site's better than a flaming turd covered in eggplant emojis. But if it isn't - there's only one way it can go from here on in.
