                    <h2>Alchemy - A Yale-NUS Literary Collective</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alchemy was a Literary Collective that would share poems, short stories, art and other creative
                        projects by Yale-NUS students. Given that it was a literary collective, I really wanted the logo
                        to be a logotype, instead of it being iconographic or graphic-heavy, I wanted to let the text do
                        most of the heavy lifting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ouroboros was a visual element I introduced due to its long history with alchemic practices.
                        It is an image linked with the Philosopher's Stone (not the Harry Potter version) - a symbol of 
                        the eternal unity of all things, the cycle of birth and death from which the alchemist sought 
                        release and liberation. Therefore it was only fitting that it be the visual flair in the logotype.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the sort of symmetrical natures of the letters A and Y, I modified them to form the gaping
                        mouths of a double ouroboros, using a serif font with long serifs to make the fangs of the ouroboros 
                        visually coherent with the font.
                    </p>
