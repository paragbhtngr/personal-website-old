                    <h2>The Flying Fido</h2>
                    <p>
                        Possibly one of my favorite projects to work on in recent memory, The Flying Fido is a 
                        pet relocation service to help you transport your pets from one country to another, 
                        making the entire process hassle-free.
                    </p>

                        <div><img style="width: 100%;" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/flyingfido-1.jpg" alt=""></div>

                    </div>
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">
                        <div><img style="width: 100%;" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/flyingfido-4.jpg" alt=""></div>

                    <p>
                        The logo went through various iterations, including superhero-dogs, dogs bounding out of
                        boxes and even an aviator dogs. Ultimately I decided that it would be best for the dog to
                        be riding pillion on this trip. The idea of a dog emerging out of a box or cage also
                        seemed to suggest that it had been a box for the duration of the trip, which did not sound
                        particularly inviting either. Ultimately, the inspiration came from the classic image of
                        the dog sticking its head out of a car window, except the car was replaced with airplane
                        windows - not a realistic depiction of airline travel perhaps, but sentiment-wise, it hit
                        all the right notes.
                    </p>

                        As for the choice of dog, there were a lot of strong contenders - the owner's pug was one
                        of them, but pugs are not necessarily adored by all. A shiba inu, or "doge", was another
                        contender, but felt a little too meme-y and a look of bemused wonderment wasn't the emotion
                        I was going for. In the end, I went with corgis, because in my opinion, they are the 
                        floofiest, and they generally have the expression of pure happiness and excitement that I
                        was going for. They are also ideal candidates for being taken somewhere because their tiny
                        little legs aren't going to carry them very far on their own.
