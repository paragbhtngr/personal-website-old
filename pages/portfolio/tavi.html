                    <p>
                        Tavi was designed to be a travel app that used your facebook data to suggest travel destinations 
                        and itineraries for you. Sort of like Google Trips, but this was before Google Trips was a 
                        thing.

                        The name for the application is a Japanese word, which inspired the origami crane logo. Given 
                        origami's Japanese roots it felt like an appropriate styling for the logo. The choice of a crane
                        was fairly straightforward at that point, because it represents the freedom that the app hoped to
                        provide. The freedom to just be able to fly anywhere you want seemed to be best expressed by the
                        crane.
