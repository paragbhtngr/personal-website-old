                <h2>Portrait of Michael C Hall from Dexter</h2>
                <p>
                    I think there's something about me that's attracted to the villain, anti-hero and 
                    the man with a compromised sense of morality. But that's enough psychotherapy for
                    today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I drew this portrait in 2013, after finishing my A Levels, and over a 6-month gap
                    between school and university. Suffering from an existential crisis, not much to 
                    do and an interest in photorealism, I decided to spend 60 hours finishing up this
                    portrait of Michael C Hall, having finished binge watching Dexter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've never attempted anything as time-consuming since, although I would like to at
                    some point.
