                    <h2>Nullify</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nullify was a fire detection startup that received the NUS Practicum grant with a patented design for fire detection 
                        systems using computer vision and deep learning to understand ignition and fire spread patterns. The logo and visual
                        identity of the logo was inspired by thermostat designs, the phi (Î¦) symbol and the power symbol (<i class="fa fa-power-off" aria-hidden="true"></i>).
                        Since we were dealing with fires, blue-green was the clear choice to go for and were the exact opposite colors of a fire.
                        (in fact, if you hue-rotate the colors of the nullify logo by 180-ish degrees, you get the colors of a fire - almost, since
                        some artistic license was taken to make the colors a bit more appealing).
