                    <p>
                        In 2015, I was asked to design the logo of for the World School Debating Championships. The logo was a remake
                        of a design that was being played around with at the time. The logo is an homage to the singapore flag and the
                        crescent with 5 stars. The asymmetrical and off-centre core of the logo was a vestige from the previous design
                        - a call to think laterally. To offset the weight visually, I positioned the stars and the wsdc logo to the
                        right, to act as a counterbalance.
