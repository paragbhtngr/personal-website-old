            <h2>Volvox</h2>
            <p>
                Logo design for a startup working with decentralized insurance technology. The name and design of the logo came
                from having decentralization as the core principle of the projects being worked on. I thought of the name Volvox
                recalling a picture and caption in a biology textbook I had read decades ago. A volvox colony is a cluster of 
                single-celled eukaryotic algae functioning together with a sort of hive mind, behaving like one large organism -
                also the name Man o' War probably wasn't appropriate for the company. In a lot of ways, Volvox was a good biological
                analogy for what we were trying to do with the company, and it had a strong, crisp sounding name. So that's the
                direction in which we went.
            </p>
            <p>
                The logo design at that point was fairly straightforward. A volvox cell looks pretty cool in and of itself, so I
                decided to use it as visual inspiration for the logo, creating an illustrative diagram almost of the cell. The
                colors black and green were inspired by microscopic views of these cells, and it just so happens that these were 
                also great tech colors - being traditional terminal hacker colors, the colors used in the Matrix, as well as the
                color scheme of tech companies like NVidia and Razer.
