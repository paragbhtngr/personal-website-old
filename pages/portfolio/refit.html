                    <h2>Refit Equipments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Refit Equipments Pvt Ltd was an orthopaedics manufacturing and distribution company. The logo was a redesign of a draft logo
                        made early in the creation of the company, and prominently featured red as its primary color and blue as its secondary color.
                        I decided to keep the red primary color in the design of the new logo. For the shape I looked at other players in the 
                        orthopaedics industry, who all seemed to feature active figures jumping or stretching with their arms out. I wanted to
                        incorporate that shape and visual style into the logo. The three visual elements I combined to form the logo were the letter
                        R, a double arrow chevron to denote moving forward and upward and the general curve and feel of the active human form in logos
                        from similar companies in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A flat version of the design was also created for printing on small objects and packaging where high quality versions of the
                        logo could not be used.
                    </p>
