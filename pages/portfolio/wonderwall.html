                        Logo Design for a hackathon project called Wonderwalls - an augmented reality application 
                        that lets you create virtual graffiti anywhere on the face of the earth using your phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine leaving a message, a picture or a doodle anywhere on the face of the earth for 
                        everyone, someone special, or even just for yourself. All the creativity and the freedom
                        to create your own personal Banksy, without any spray paint, mess, or cops pulling you up
                        for vandalism. Wonderwalls was meant to allow you to say it without having to spray it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using geolocation, and compass direction to get an approximate pinpoint on where you were
                        and which direction you were facing, Wonderwalls would match your camera's view with 
                        the location data using computer vision and display any grafitti tagged there that you had
                        created or that had been shared with you.
