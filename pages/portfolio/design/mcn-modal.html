                <h2>May Contain Nuts</h2>
                <p>
                    May Contain Nuts is what happens when a couple of Yale-NUS alumni decide they want to
                    continue doing improv after graduation, and go around in a circle thinking of punny
                    names to call their newly minted improv troupe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started thinking about possible design directions we could take, the main goal being
                    to inject humor into the mix (what even is the point of the group otherwise?). In that
                    vein, I created a basic logo as a starting point, and explored a few variants that I
                    found interesting. Exploring the idea of a police line-up of nuts (an allusion to the
                    Usual Suspects), or going slightly darker with the humor - someone who had an anaphylactic
                    shock due to being allergic to nuts (stylistically, I decided to go with a Cyanide & 
                    Happiness aesthetic to strengthen the visual reference). I also decided to incorporate
                    one of the most classic pranks of all time into a logo for us - the old snake in a tin 
                    of nuts routine (Personally, this was my favorite due to the reference and the long 
                    association with comedy).
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">
                    <div><img class="lazyload" style="width: 100%;" data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/mcn-draft-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div><img class="lazyload" style="width: 100%;" data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/mcn-draft-2.jpg" alt=""></div>
                </div>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%; margin-top: -5px;">
                    <div><img class="lazyload" style="width: 100%;" data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/mcn-draft-3.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <div><img class="lazyload" style="width: 100%;" data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/portfolio/mcn-draft-4.jpg" alt=""></div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the end, we decided to opt for the more traditional route. The colors are an homage to 
                    our formation and shared status as Yale-NUS alumni, orange and blue being our school colors,
                    and the background texture of nuts is meant to symbolize batik style printing as an homage 
                    to the batik elephant pants that are sort of an unofficial uniform for Yale-NUS students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, if you're disappointed that we didn't go for some of the other designs, fret
                    not! Some of the other ideas were put to good use for our second show - Criminally nuts!
