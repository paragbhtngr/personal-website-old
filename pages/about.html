    Hi! Thanks for checking out my website :D
</p>
<p>
    I'm Parag Bhatnagar - a Yale-NUS Computer Science Major with an interest in pretty, functional things. I like to build
    stuff for the web and have a love-hate relationship with CSS and a mostly love relationship with Webpack. I dabble in 
    digital art, graphic design and the occasional 3D project. You can check out a resume of my work 
    <a style="color: #4169e1" href="{{ site.github.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Resume-2-Nov-17.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

    I have a fondness for accents, a love of movies and an obsession with stand-up comedy. I'm a strong believer in the 
    artistic value of graphic novels (seriously - Alex Ross' paintings are worthy of any gallery) and a fervent opponent of 
    pretension and ego in the design process.

    This site is currently a work-in-progress, so don't panic if something goes wrong. Feel free to apply aformentioned 
    philosophy to your life, as you see fit.
