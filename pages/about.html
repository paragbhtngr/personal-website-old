    Hi! Thanks for checking out my website!
</p>
<p>
    I'm Parag - a Yale-NUS Computer Science Major with an interest in pretty, functional things. I'm currently part of the 
    Digital Innovation Lab at Singapore Airlines where I take problems and come up with prototypes for tech-based solutions.
    I mostly work on building stuff for the web, but I dabble in mobile and AR/VR and hardware projects on occasion. I work
    at the intersection of tech and design, so I also do art - both digital and traditional, graphic design and the occasional 
    3D project. You can check out a selection of my work and past projects on
    <a style="color: #620fca" href="{{ site.github.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Resume-2-Jan-18.pdf">my resum√©</a>. Or, if
    you'd like a more detailed version, I'm always happy to elaborate and explicate over a cup of coffee. 
</p>
<p>
    I'm a comedy nerd, and am part of two extremely funny improv comedy groups here in Singapore - 
    <a style="color: #620fca" href="https://www.facebook.com/MayContainNutsImprov/">May Contain Nuts</a> and
    <a style="color: #620fca" href="https://www.facebook.com/indianimprovtheatre/">Indian Improv Theatre Singapore (IITSG)</a>.
    So come check us out for a fantastically fun evening. I have a fondness for accents and voices, languages, wordplay and 
    other such linguistic shennanigans, an obsession with stand-up comedy and a love of comic books, movies and pointless 
    trivia.

    to at the moment. Feel free to apply aformentioned principle to your life, as you see fit.
